Table: Problems

Column Name	Type
problem_id	int
likes	int
dislikes	int

problem_id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the number of likes and dislikes for a LeetCode problem.

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the low-quality problems. A LeetCode problem is low-quality if the like percentage of the problem (number of likes divided by the total number of votes) is strictly less than 60%.

Return the result table ordered by problem_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example :


Problems table:

problem_id	likes	dislikes
6	1290	425
11	2677	8659
1	4446	2760
7	8569	6086
13	2050	4164
10	9002	7446

Output:

problem_id
7
10
11
13
